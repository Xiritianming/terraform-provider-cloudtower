  ip       = "192.168.1.1"
  username = "admin"
  password = "password"
}
```

### Connect a cluster and add it to a datacenter

Connect a cluster, and also add the cluster to a datacenter.

```hcl
data "cloudtower_datacenter" "sample_datacenter" {
  name = "sample_datacenter"
}

resource "cloudtower_cluster" "sample_cluster" {
  ip       = "192.168.1.1"
  username = "admin"
  password = "password"
  datacenter_id = data.cloudtower_datacenter.sample_datacenter.datacenters[0].id
}
```

## Restrictions

If an cluster has already been connected to cloudtower, it will throw an error if you try to connect it again. You can use datasource to handle it or import the cluster to terraform state.
